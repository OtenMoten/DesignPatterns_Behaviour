/**
 * In this package you will learn how to deal with access on elements.
 * The keypoint of the "Iterator"-pattern is that it offers the possibility to
 * gain access on specific elements without uncover the structure or the inner
 * state of the elements.
 *
 * Enjoy the course and feel free to contribute.

# DesignPattern_Behaviour
This is the first public release of my library that contains various behaviour design patterns, especially for Java.

Any code must be understandably, clearly and reusable.

You will find the behaviour design patterns in the "src"-directory. Within the directory, every folder represents a behaviour design pattern.

Feel free to contribute.
